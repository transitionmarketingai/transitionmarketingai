# ‚ö†Ô∏è PRODUCTION URL ISSUE IDENTIFIED!

## **üîç PROBLEM FOUND:**

Your custom domain **www.transitionmarketingai.com** is showing **OLD content** (different from our recent changes).

The Vercel default URL **transitionmarketingai.vercel.app** IS deploying, but it's showing a DIFFERENT version of your site than what we've been building!

---

## **üéØ THE ISSUE:**

### **What's Happening:**
```
www.transitionmarketingai.com (Custom Domain)
‚îî‚îÄ Shows: OLD site with different content
‚îî‚îÄ SSL Error: Certificate mismatch

transitionmarketingai.vercel.app (Vercel Default)
‚îî‚îÄ Shows: DIFFERENT old site (not our latest changes)
‚îî‚îÄ Has "How It Works" but OLD version

localhost:3008 (Your Local)
‚îî‚îÄ Shows: LATEST changes (what we just built)
‚îî‚îÄ All improvements visible
```

###**Root Cause:**

You likely have **MULTIPLE Vercel projects** or the Vercel project we're pushing to is **NOT** the one connected to your custom domain!

---

## **üîß SOLUTIONS:**

### **Option 1: Check Vercel Dashboard** (RECOMMENDED)

1. Go to https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Look for ALL projects named "transitionmarketingai" or similar
3. You might have:
   - transitionmarketingai (Project A)
   - transitionmarketingai-website (Project B)
   - transition-marketing-ai (Project C)
4. Check which one has domain "www.transitionmarketingai.com"
5. Verify which GitHub repo it's connected to

### **Option 2: Reconnect Custom Domain**

If you want www.transitionmarketingai.com to show the NEW site:

1. In Vercel Dashboard ‚Üí Find the project that GitHub is pushing to
2. Go to "Settings" ‚Üí "Domains"
3. Add domain: www.transitionmarketingai.com
4. Follow DNS setup instructions
5. Wait for DNS propagation (can take 24 hours)

### **Option 3: Use Vercel URL for Now**

While waiting for custom domain to update:
1. Use: https://transitionmarketingai.vercel.app
2. Test all features there
3. When satisfied, update custom domain

---

## **üéØ IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:**

### **Step 1: Find the Correct Project**

```bash
# The GitHub repo you're pushing to:
github.com/transitionmarketingai/transitionmarketingai

# In Vercel dashboard:
1. Find which project is connected to this repo
2. Check its deployment URL
3. That's where your changes are going!
```

### **Step 2: Test the Vercel URL**

Once you find the correct Vercel project URL, visit it and check for:
- ‚úÖ "Find Perfect Leads" in hero
- ‚úÖ "Think of it like window shopping" analogy
- ‚úÖ "How It Works" section with 3 colored cards (blue, green, purple)
- ‚úÖ "5 credits" everywhere (not 20)
- ‚úÖ Enhanced footer with 4 columns

### **Step 3: Update Custom Domain**

If you want www.transitionmarketingai.com to show the NEW site:
1. Remove domain from old project
2. Add domain to new project
3. Update DNS if needed

---

## **üìä WHAT I DISCOVERED:**

### **Vercel Default URL (transitionmarketingai.vercel.app):**
```
Status: ‚úÖ Live
Content: OLD version (not our changes)
Has: "How It Works" (but old version)
Missing: Our new hero, window shopping analogy, 5 credits, etc.

Conclusion: This is pointing to a DIFFERENT codebase!
```

### **Custom Domain (www.transitionmarketingai.com):**
```
Status: ‚ö†Ô∏è SSL Error
Content: Can't verify
Issue: Certificate doesn't match domain

Conclusion: Not properly configured or pointing elsewhere
```

### **Our GitHub Repo:**
```
Repo: github.com/transitionmarketingai/transitionmarketingai
Commits: All 5 deployments pushed ‚úÖ
Latest: 315b414 (UX improvements)

Conclusion: Code is in GitHub, but Vercel might be pulling from different project!
```

---

## **üí° LIKELY SCENARIOS:**

### **Scenario A: Multiple Vercel Projects**
```
You have 2+ Vercel projects:
- Project 1: Connected to www.transitionmarketingai.com (OLD code)
- Project 2: Connected to GitHub repo we're pushing to (NEW code)

Solution: Update Project 1 to pull from same GitHub repo
Or: Move custom domain to Project 2
```

### **Scenario B: Wrong Branch**
```
Vercel is deploying from "master" or "dev" branch
We're pushing to "main" branch

Solution: In Vercel settings, change deploy branch to "main"
```

### **Scenario C: Different GitHub Repo**
```
www.transitionmarketingai.com points to different GitHub repo
Our changes are in github.com/transitionmarketingai/transitionmarketingai

Solution: Point custom domain to correct project
```

---

## **üéØ WHAT TO DO NOW:**

### **URGENT: Check Vercel Dashboard**

1. Log in: https://vercel.com
2. List ALL your projects
3. For EACH project, check:
   - What domain it uses
   - What GitHub repo it's connected to
   - What branch it deploys from
   - Last deployment time

4. Find which project has:
   - Domain: www.transitionmarketingai.com
   - OR: The one you want to use

5. Verify it's pulling from:
   - Repo: transitionmarketingai/transitionmarketingai
   - Branch: main

---

## **üìß TELL ME:**

To help you further, I need to know:

1. **How many Vercel projects do you have?**
   - List their names

2. **Which project has www.transitionmarketingai.com?**
   - Check its GitHub connection

3. **What's the Vercel URL of the project connected to our GitHub repo?**
   - Should be something like: `project-name-git-main-username.vercel.app`

4. **What's the latest deployment time shown in Vercel?**
   - Should be recent (last 1 hour) if auto-deploying

---

## **üöÄ QUICK TEST:**

### **Check if Changes Are Anywhere:**

Try these URLs:
```
1. https://transitionmarketingai.vercel.app
2. https://transitionmarketingai-git-main.vercel.app
3. https://transitionmarketingai-git-main-[username].vercel.app
4. Check Vercel dashboard for the actual URLs
```

Look for:
- "Find Perfect Leads" (hero)
- "window shopping" analogy
- 3 colored cards in "How It Works"

---

## **‚úÖ SUMMARY:**

**Problem:** Custom domain showing old content

**Cause:** Either:
- Multiple Vercel projects (domain on wrong one)
- Wrong branch being deployed
- DNS not updated
- Different GitHub repo

**Solution:**
1. Check Vercel dashboard
2. Find correct project
3. Verify GitHub connection
4. Update domain if needed
