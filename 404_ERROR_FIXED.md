# ✅ 404 ERROR FIXED!

## 🐛 The Problem:
Site was showing 404 error due to compilation failure:
```
Module parse failed: Identifier 'campaigns' has already been declared
```

## ✅ The Fix:
**Removed duplicate `campaigns` declaration**

**Before (Line 257):**
```typescript
const [campaigns] = useState(DEMO_CAMPAIGNS);  ← OLD, removed
```

**After:**
```typescript
// Removed - using the new one with setter below
```

**New Declaration (Line 273):**
```typescript
const [campaigns, setCampaigns] = useState(DEMO_CAMPAIGNS);  ← KEPT
```

This allows campaigns to be editable (pause/resume/delete).

## 🎯 Result:
✅ **Site compiles successfully now!**  
✅ **No more 404 errors**
