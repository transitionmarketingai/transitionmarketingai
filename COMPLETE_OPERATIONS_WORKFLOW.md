# Complete Operations Workflow - How The Business Actually Works

## üéØ THE COMPLETE PROCESS (Customer Pays ‚Üí Leads Delivered)

---

## STEP 1: CUSTOMER SIGNS UP & PAYS

### What Happens:

**Customer Side:**
```
1. Customer completes onboarding
2. Chooses Growth plan (‚Çπ14,999/month)
3. Starts 7-day free trial (no payment yet)
4. After 7 days, if satisfied:
   ‚Üí Enters payment details
   ‚Üí Pays ‚Çπ14,999 via Razorpay (UPI/Card/NetBanking)
   ‚Üí Subscription becomes active
```

**Your Side (Automated):**
```
1. Payment received webhook from Razorpay
2. Subscription status ‚Üí "active"
3. Customer gets confirmation email/WhatsApp
4. Internal notification sent to YOUR operations team:
   
   "üéâ New Customer Alert!
   
   Customer: ABC Real Estate
   Plan: Growth (50 leads/month)
   Industry: Real Estate
   Target: Home buyers in Mumbai, 2BHK, ‚Çπ80L-‚Çπ1Cr

## STEP 6: BILLING & QUOTA TRACKING (AUTOMATED)

### How Billing Works:

**Monthly Cycle:**

```
Customer: ABC Real Estate
Plan: Growth (‚Çπ14,999/month, 50 leads quota)

Day 1 (Oct 1): Subscription renews
  ‚Ä¢ Razorpay charges ‚Çπ14,999
  ‚Ä¢ Quota resets to 0/50
  ‚Ä¢ Rollover from last month: +5 leads
  ‚Ä¢ Total available: 55 leads

Day 5: 12 leads delivered
  ‚Ä¢ Used: 12/55
  ‚Ä¢ Remaining: 43
  ‚Ä¢ All within quota (no extra charge)

Day 15: 30 leads delivered (total)
  ‚Ä¢ Used: 30/55
  ‚Ä¢ Remaining: 25
  ‚Ä¢ Still within quota

Day 25: 50 leads delivered (total)
  ‚Ä¢ Used: 50/55
  ‚Ä¢ Remaining: 5
  ‚Ä¢ Still within quota

Day 27: 52 leads delivered (total)
  ‚Ä¢ Used: 52/55
  ‚Ä¢ Remaining: 3
  ‚Ä¢ Still within quota (rollover buffer)

Day 30: 58 leads delivered (total)
  ‚Ä¢ Used: 58/55
  ‚Ä¢ Exceeded by: 3 leads
  ‚Ä¢ Overage charge: 3 √ó ‚Çπ400 = ‚Çπ1,200
  
  Invoice generated:
  - Base subscription: ‚Çπ14,999 (already paid)
  - Overage: 3 leads √ó ‚Çπ400 = ‚Çπ1,200
  - Total additional: ‚Çπ1,200
  
  Razorpay automatically charges ‚Çπ1,200
  
Next month (Nov 1):
  ‚Ä¢ Quota resets to 0/50
  ‚Ä¢ No rollover (used all + more)
```

---

## STEP 7: YOUR AD SPEND MANAGEMENT

### How You Manage Money:

**Your Ad Account Balance:**

```
You have: 100 customers
Average daily budget per customer: ‚Çπ900
Total daily ad spend: ‚Çπ90,000/day
Monthly ad spend: ‚Çπ27,00,000 (‚Çπ27 Lakhs)

Your Revenue:
100 customers √ó ‚Çπ15,000 avg = ‚Çπ15,00,000/month

Your Costs:
Ad spend: ‚Çπ27,00,000 
(Wait, this doesn't work!)

Actually:
You DON'T spend ‚Çπ900/day per customer!

You spend based on LEAD DELIVERY:
Target: 50 leads/month per customer
Cost per lead: ‚Çπ280
Monthly spend per customer: 50 √ó ‚Çπ280 = ‚Çπ14,000

For 100 customers:
Ad spend: ‚Çπ14,00,000/month (‚Çπ14 Lakhs)
Revenue: ‚Çπ15,00,000/month
Gross profit: ‚Çπ1,00,000/month
```

**How to Control Ad Spend:**

```
Facebook Campaign Settings:

Daily Budget: ‚Çπ800
Monthly Budget Cap: ‚Çπ15,000 (to not overspend)

Once you've delivered 50 leads (quota met):
‚Üí Pause campaign automatically
‚Üí Or reduce budget to ‚Çπ100/day (slow mode)
‚Üí Or keep running if customer buying overages

Smart automation:
IF leads_delivered >= quota AND customer_not_buying_overages:
  THEN pause_campaign()
```

---

## ü§ñ AUTOMATION LEVELS

### Level 1: Fully Manual (Month 1-3)
**You do everything manually:**
- Create campaigns in Facebook/Google interface
- Monitor daily
- Adjust budgets manually

---

### Level 2: Semi-Automated (Month 4-6)
**Some automation:**
- Use Facebook/Google APIs to create campaigns
- Automated lead reception via webhooks
- Automated notifications
- Manual optimization still
