UPDATE leads SET name = contact_name WHERE name IS NULL;
ALTER TABLE leads ALTER COLUMN name SET NOT NULL;

```sql
-- Creates 3 new tables:
1. unlocked_leads (track unlocks)
2. saved_searches (search templates)
3. lead_searches (search history)

-- Plus 3 helper functions
```

**Instructions:**
1. Open Supabase Dashboard
2. Go to SQL Editor
3. Copy contents of `database-fix-final.sql`
4. Click "Run"
5. Copy contents of `new-database-tables.sql`
