## 🎯 What's Different (Old vs New)

### **Old Self-Service Model:**
```
User → Connect Facebook → Create Campaign → Set Budget → Launch → Wait → Get Leads
Time: 2-3 hours setup
Value: Depends on ad performance
Risk: User might not do it
```

### **New AI-First Model:**
```
User → Sign Up → AI Finds Prospects (automatic) → Review AI Emails → Send → Get Responses
Time: 10 minutes/day
Value: Guaranteed prospects daily
Risk: None (AI always delivers)
```
