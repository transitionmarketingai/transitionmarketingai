## 🛠️ TECHNICAL APPROACH:

### LocalStorage Structure:
```javascript
{
  "leads": [...],           // All leads
  "messages": {...},        // Messages by lead ID
  "campaigns": [...],       // All campaigns
  "settings": {...},        // User settings
  "customer": {...}         // Customer profile
}
```

### Key Features:
- ✅ All data persists across page refreshes
- ✅ Demo mode still works (uses demo data if no saved data)
- ✅ Easy to reset (clear localStorage)
- ✅ No backend needed
- ✅ Fully functional for demos

## ⏱️ TOTAL ESTIMATED TIME: 4 hours

**But we'll do it incrementally!**

## 🚀 STARTING WITH PHASE 1...

**Ready to begin?** I'll build Phase 1 (Lead Actions) first, test it, then move to Phase 2.

This way:
- ✅ You can test each feature as it's built
- ✅ No breaking previous work
- ✅ Easy to adjust if needed
- ✅ Clean, working progress

**Shall I start with Phase 1: Lead Actions?** 🎯
