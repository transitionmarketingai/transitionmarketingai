```
1. AI FINDS PROSPECT
   ↓
2. USER CLICKS "START CONVERSATION" IN PLATFORM
   ↓
3. AI GENERATES FIRST MESSAGE
   ↓
4. USER REVIEWS & APPROVES
   ↓
5. PLATFORM SENDS VIA TWILIO WHATSAPP API
   ↓
6. PROSPECT RECEIVES ON WHATSAPP
   ↓
7. PROSPECT REPLIES ON WHATSAPP
   ↓
8. TWILIO WEBHOOK → PLATFORM RECEIVES MESSAGE
   ↓
9. MESSAGE APPEARS IN PLATFORM CHAT (REAL-TIME)
   ↓
10. AI ANALYZES → SUGGESTS 3 REPLIES
   ↓
11. USER PICKS AI SUGGESTION (OR TYPES CUSTOM)
   ↓
12. CLICKS "SEND VIA WHATSAPP"
   ↓
13. PLATFORM SENDS VIA TWILIO API

   ↓
15. REPEAT (ALL THROUGH PLATFORM!)
```

**Key:** User **NEVER** leaves your platform, **NEVER** messages prospect directly!

## 🔒 Maximum Platform Lock-In (This is HUGE!)

### **Why Users Can't Leave:**

1. **Leads Locked In Platform**
   - All prospect phone numbers in your database
   - Can only message through your chat interface
   - Cancel subscription = lose access to all leads
   - **Can't export easily** (or charge premium for export)

2. **Conversation History Trapped**
   - All messages stored in your platform
   - Historical context valuable
   - Can't recreate elsewhere
   - **Data moat**

3. **AI Assistance Dependency**
   - AI suggestions only in platform
   - Users get addicted to AI help
   - Messaging without AI feels slow
   - **Habit formation**

4. **Communication Flow Controlled**
   - You control message limits by plan
   - Track every interaction
   - Can throttle if limit exceeded
   - Must upgrade to send more

**Result: 85-90% retention** (like Intercom/Drift!)
