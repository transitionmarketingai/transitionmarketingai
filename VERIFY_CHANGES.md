# ✅ How to Verify Changes on Localhost

## Localhost URL:
**http://localhost:3001**

(I've cleared the cache and restarted the server)

## What to Check:

### 1. Hero Section
- ✅ Should say: **"Get Verified Leads Delivered to Your Dashboard"**
- ❌ Should NOT say: "B2B Leads" or "Verified B2B Leads"

### 2. Navigation (Top Right)
- ✅ Should show: **"Client Login"** button
- ✅ Should show: **"Admin"** button  
- ❌ Should NOT show: "Watch Demo" or demo links

### 3. Hero Description
- ✅ Should say: "We're a lead generation company..."
- ❌ Should NOT mention B2B

### 4. Value Props (Below Hero)
- ✅ Should say: "Quality Assurance" (not "Money-Back Guarantee")
- ✅ All checkmarks should be **blue** (not green)

### 5. Why Choose Us Section
- ✅ 4 cards in a grid (short, concise)
- ✅ Blue icons (not green/purple/amber)
- ✅ Stats bar with blue background

### 6. Quality Section
- ✅ Should have "How We Ensure Quality" 
- ✅ 3-step infographic with numbers
- ❌ Should NOT have money-back guarantee

### 7. Color Scheme
- ✅ Only **Blue** (#2563eb) and **Slate Gray**
- ❌ NO green, purple, amber colors

## If Changes Still Not Showing:

1. **Hard Refresh**: Cmd+Shift+R (Mac) or Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows)
2. **Clear Browser Cache**: Go to browser settings → Clear cache
3. **Try Incognito Mode**: Open http://localhost:3001 in incognito
4. **Check Console**: Open DevTools (F12) and check for errors

## For Production:

The changes ARE committed and pushed. If production doesn't show changes:
1. Check Vercel dashboard for build status
2. Wait 5 minutes (CDN cache)
3. Force refresh on production site
4. Check Vercel logs
