   - Suggests ad creatives
   - Calculates estimated cost per lead
   - Creates campaign blueprint
        ↓
6. Campaign setup (YOU do this - 1-2 hours):

   ✓ Create targeting based on their criteria
   ✓ Generate ad creatives with AI
   ✓ Set up lead form with qualification questions
   ✓ Configure webhooks to receive leads

```

**Technical Setup:**
```typescript
// After payment confirmed
async function onCustomerSignup(customer: CustomerOnboarding) {
  // 1. Create customer account
  const user = await createCustomerAccount({
    email: customer.email,
    phone: customer.phone,
    business_name: customer.business_name,
    plan: customer.plan,
    subscription_start: new Date(),
    subscription_status: 'active'
  });
  
  // 2. Set up lead quota
  await createLeadQuota({
    customer_id: user.id,
    monthly_quota: getPlanQuota(customer.plan), // 50 for Growth
    used_this_month: 0,
    reset_date: getNextMonthStart()
  });
  
  // 3. Create campaign blueprint with AI
  const campaignPlan = await generateCampaignPlan({
    industry: customer.industry,
    target_audience: customer.target_audience,
    service_description: customer.service_description
  });
  
  // campaignPlan = {
  //   recommended_platforms: ['facebook', 'google'],
  //   estimated_daily_budget: 800, // ₹800/day
  //   estimated_cost_per_lead: 280, // ₹280/lead
  //   ad_creatives: [...], // AI-generated
  //   targeting: {...},
  //   lead_form_questions: [...]
  // }
  
  // 4. Create campaigns in YOUR ad accounts
  const facebookCampaign = await createFacebookCampaign({
    customer_id: user.id,
    targeting: {
      locations: customer.target_audience.location.cities,
      age_min: customer.target_audience.age_range.min,
      age_max: customer.target_audience.age_range.max,
      interests: deriveInterests(customer.industry, customer.target_audience.description)
    },
    budget: {
      daily: 800, // ₹800/day
      currency: 'INR'
    },
    creative: campaignPlan.ad_creatives[0],
    lead_form: {
      questions: campaignPlan.lead_form_questions,
      privacy_policy: 'yourplatform.in/privacy'
    }
  });
  
  // 5. Set up webhook to receive leads
  await facebook.subscribeToLeads({
    form_id: facebookCampaign.lead_form_id,
    webhook_url: `yourplatform.in/api/webhooks/facebook/leads/${user.id}`
  });
  
  // 6. Send welcome email & WhatsApp
  await sendWelcomeEmail(user);
  await sendWhatsAppMessage(customer.phone, `

Your lead generation campaign is being set up.
You'll start receiving qualified leads within 24-48 hours.

Dashboard: yourplatform.in/dashboard
Support: +91-XXXXXXXXXX (WhatsApp)

- Team [Your Platform]
  `);
  
  // 7. Notify your team
  await notifyInternalTeam({
    type: 'new_customer',
    customer: user,
    plan: customer.plan,
    action_required: 'Set up and launch ad campaigns'
  });
  
  return user;
}
```

---

#### Phase 2: Campaign Launch (Day 2-3) - Manual Work

**What YOUR TEAM does:**

**Option A: Fully Manual (Initially)**
```
1. Operations person logs into YOUR Facebook Business Manager
2. Reviews AI-generated campaign blueprint
3. Creates ad campaign manually:
   - Uploads creatives
   - Sets targeting
   - Configures lead form
   - Sets budget
   - Launches
4. Repeats for Google Ads if applicable
5. Monitors first 24 hours closely
6. Adjusts targeting/budget if needed
```

**Option B: Semi-Automated (After 3-6 months)**
```
1. AI generates campaign automatically via Facebook/Google APIs
2. Human reviews and approves
3. Campaign goes live
4. AI monitors and adjusts automatically
5. Human only intervenes if issues
```

#### Phase 3: Lead Generation (Ongoing) - Automated

**How Leads Flow In:**

```
1. Facebook/Google ad is shown to target audience
        ↓
2. User clicks ad → Lead form opens (inside Facebook/Google app)
        ↓
3. Form is pre-filled with their info (name, email, phone)
        ↓
4. User adds custom answers (e.g., "When are you looking to buy?")
        ↓
5. User clicks "Submit"
        ↓
6. Facebook/Google sends data to YOUR webhook instantly
        ↓
   POST https://yourplatform.in/api/webhooks/facebook/leads/customer123
   {
     "leadgen_id": "123456",
     "form_id": "789012",
     "created_time": "2024-10-13T10:30:00+0000"
   }
        ↓
7. Your webhook handler:
   a) Fetches full lead data from Facebook API
   b) Runs AI qualification check
   c) Calculates quality score (0-100)
   d) Saves to database
   e) Sends to customer's dashboard
   f) Notifies customer via WhatsApp/Email
   g) Updates quota tracking
        ↓
8. Customer sees lead in dashboard within 30 seconds!
```

**Webhook Handler Code:**
```typescript
// app/api/webhooks/facebook/leads/[customerId]/route.ts

  const [messages, setMessages] = useState([]);
  const [newMessage, setNewMessage] = useState('');
  
  async function sendMessage() {
    // Send via YOUR WhatsApp Business API
    await fetch('/api/messaging/send', {
      method: 'POST',
      body: JSON.stringify({
        lead_id: leadId,
        channel: 'whatsapp',
        content: newMessage
      })
    });
    
    // Message is sent from YOUR business number
    // e.g., "ABC Real Estate via LeadGen Platform"
  }
  
  return (
    <div className="conversation">
      <div className="messages">
        {messages.map(msg => (

            key={msg.id}
            content={msg.content}
            sender={msg.sender}
            timestamp={msg.timestamp}
          />
        ))}
