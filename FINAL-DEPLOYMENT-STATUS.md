## **⚠️ CRITICAL REMINDER:**

### **You MUST Run These SQL Scripts:**

**Go to:** https://app.supabase.com → SQL Editor

**Run in order:**
```sql
-- Script 1: database-fix-final.sql
ALTER TABLE leads ALTER COLUMN name DROP NOT NULL;
UPDATE leads SET name = contact_name WHERE name IS NULL;
ALTER TABLE leads ALTER COLUMN name SET NOT NULL;
NOTIFY pgrst, 'reload schema';

-- Script 2: new-database-tables.sql
(Creates unlocked_leads, saved_searches tables)
```

**Why This Is Critical:**
- Without these: ❌ Features work but data doesn't persist
- With these: ✅ Everything 100% functional

---
