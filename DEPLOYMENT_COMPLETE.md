## ✅ Latest Fix Deployed

### **Fixed: Smooth Navigation**
**Problem:** Whole page was scrolling (including sidebar), causing scroll position to reset when navigating between pages.

**Solution:** 
- Changed layout from `min-h-screen` to `h-screen overflow-hidden`
- Made sidebar fixed (no scrolling)
- Made main content area independently scrollable with `overflow-y-auto`
- Scroll position now preserved in sidebar
- Only content area scrolls smoothly

**Files Changed:**
- `src/app/dashboard/layout.tsx` - Updated with fixed positioning
