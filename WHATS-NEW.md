## 📝 **Database Fix Required**

### **Important: Run This SQL in Supabase**

I've created `database-fix-final.sql` with the fix. You need to run it in your Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Fix leads table - make name nullable first
ALTER TABLE leads ALTER COLUMN name DROP NOT NULL;

-- Update existing records
UPDATE leads SET name = contact_name WHERE name IS NULL;

-- Make name NOT NULL again
ALTER TABLE leads ALTER COLUMN name SET NOT NULL;

-- Refresh schema cache
NOTIFY pgrst, 'reload schema';
```

**Why this is needed:**
- The code now sends `name` field when creating leads
- But existing database constraint was blocking it
- This fix allows the lead generation to work properly

---

## 🎯 **User Experience Improvements**

### **Before:**
- ❌ No feedback when actions completed
- ❌ Users didn't know if signup/signin worked
- ❌ Lead generation happened silently
- ❌ Weak passwords were allowed
- ❌ Export had no confirmation

### **After:**
- ✅ Every action has clear feedback
- ✅ Loading states show progress
- ✅ Success messages with emojis
- ✅ Errors are user-friendly
- ✅ Password strength enforced
- ✅ Export confirms success
