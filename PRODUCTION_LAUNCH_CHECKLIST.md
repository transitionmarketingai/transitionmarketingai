## üéØ WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE TO MAKE IT FULLY PRODUCTION-READY

### **Priority 1: CRITICAL (Must Do Before Launch)** üî¥

#### **1. Set Up Supabase Database** ‚è±Ô∏è ~30 minutes

2. Go to SQL Editor
3. Run these SQL files in order:
   ```
   a. COMPLETE_DATABASE_SCHEMA.sql
   b. additional-tables-migration.sql
   c. advanced-ai-tables-migration.sql
   ```
4. Verify tables were created (check Table Editor)

**How to verify**: 
- Check if `customers`, `leads`, `subscriptions` tables exist
- Check if Row Level Security (RLS) policies are enabled

---

#### **2. Configure Supabase Auth** ‚è±Ô∏è ~15 minutes
**Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIAL (Depends on your setup)  
**Why Critical**: Users need to verify emails and receive notifications

3. Go to Email Templates
4. Customize:
   - Confirmation email template

```

**Optional (for AI features)**:

OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
```

**Optional (for payments - not needed yet)**:
```
RAZORPAY_KEY_ID=your_razorpay_id
RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET=your_razorpay_secret
```

**Steps**:
1. Go to Vercel Dashboard
2. Select your project
3. Go to Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables
4. Add/verify the variables above
5. Click "Redeploy" if you add new ones

**How to verify**: 
- Check Vercel deployment logs for errors

### **Priority 3: NICE TO HAVE (Can Do Later)** üü¢

#### **7. Create Missing Dashboard Pages** ‚è±Ô∏è ~2-4 hours each
**Status**: ‚ùå NOT DONE
