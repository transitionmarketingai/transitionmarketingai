## ๐ Pricing Matrix (Your Starting Point)

### **Step 1: Base Cost Per Lead by Industry**

| Industry | Basic Lead | Verified Lead | Premium Lead |
|----------|-----------|---------------|--------------|
| Real Estate | โน250 | โน400 | โน600 |
| Healthcare | โน300 | โน500 | โน750 |
| IT Services | โน200 | โน350 | โน550 |
| Manufacturing | โน300 | โน450 | โน700 |
| Financial Services | โน350 | โน550 | โน850 |
| Education | โน200 | โน300 | โน500 |
| E-commerce | โน150 | โน250 | โน400 |
| Consulting | โน300 | โน500 | โน750 |
| Hospitality | โน200 | โน350 | โน550 |
| Other B2B | โน250 | โน400 | โน650 |

**Quality Definitions:**

- **Verified:** Above + verified contact, budget qualification
- **Premium:** Above + detailed profile, high intent score, pre-qualified

### **Step 2: Lead Source Costs**

Different sources have different costs:

| Source | Cost Factor | Notes |
|--------|-------------|-------|
| AI Web Scraping | 1.0x | Base cost (cheapest) |
| Facebook Ads | 1.5x | Ad spend included |
| Google Ads | 1.8x | Higher CPC |
| LinkedIn Outreach | 2.0x | Premium platform |
| Manual Research | 1.3x | Time-intensive |

**Example:**
- Real Estate Verified Lead = โน400 (base)
- If from Facebook Ads = โน400 ร 1.5 = โน600
- If from LinkedIn = โน400 ร 2.0 = โน800

---

### **Step 3: Volume Discounts**

More leads = lower cost per lead:

| Monthly Volume | Discount |
|----------------|----------|
| 1-25 leads | 0% (full price) |
| 26-50 leads | 10% discount |
| 51-100 leads | 15% discount |
| 101-200 leads | 20% discount |
| 200+ leads | 25% discount |

**Example:**
- 30 Verified Real Estate leads from AI Scraping
- Base: โน400 ร 30 = โน12,000
- With 10% discount: โน10,800

---

### **Step 4: Additional Services Pricing**

| Service | Pricing Model | Typical Cost |
|---------|---------------|--------------|
| Email Outreach | Per lead contacted | +โน50/lead |
| WhatsApp Outreach | Per lead contacted | +โน30/lead |
| Appointment Setting | Per appointment booked | +โน500/appointment |
| CRM Integration | One-time setup | โน5,000-10,000 |
| Custom Dashboard | Monthly | +โน2,000/month |
| Dedicated Account Manager | Monthly | +โน5,000/month |

## ๐ก Pricing Calculator Formula

```
STEP 1: Calculate Base Cost
Base Cost Per Lead = Industry Rate ร Lead Quality Factor

STEP 2: Apply Source Factor
Adjusted Cost = Base Cost ร Source Factor

STEP 3: Calculate Total Before Discount
Total Before Discount = Adjusted Cost ร Lead Volume

STEP 4: Apply Volume Discount
Discount Amount = Total ร Discount %
Total After Discount = Total - Discount Amount

STEP 5: Add Additional Services
Additional Services Cost = Sum of all add-ons
FINAL MONTHLY COST = Total After Discount + Additional Services
```

## ๐ Example Calculations

### **Example 1: Small Real Estate Client**

**Requirements:**

- Volume: 30 leads/month
- Quality: Verified

```
Base Cost = โน400 (Real Estate Verified)
Source Factor = 1.0x (AI Scraping)

Total Before Discount = โน400 ร 30 = โน12,000
Volume Discount = 10% (26-50 range)
Total After Discount = โน12,000 ร 0.9 = โน10,800

Email Outreach = โน50 ร 30 = โน1,500

FINAL MONTHLY COST = โน10,800 + โน1,500 = โน12,300
Cost Per Lead = โน12,300 รท 30 = โน410

## ๐ก Pro Tips

### **Pricing Psychology:**

1. **Anchor High, Then Discount**
   - "Normally this would be โน15,000, but..."
   - "For you, we can do โน12,000"

2. **Compare to Alternatives**
   - "That's like hiring 1 sales person vs getting 50 leads"
   - "Facebook ads alone would cost you โน20,000+ for same results"

3. **Break Down the Value**
   - "โน400 per lead. If even 5% convert, that's โนXXX revenue"
   - "Each client worth โนXXX, you only need 2 conversions to break even"

4. **Offer Tiers**
   - Starter: โน10,000 (25 leads)
   - Growth: โน20,000 (60 leads) โ **"Most Popular"**
   - Scale: โน40,000 (150 leads)

### **When to Go Higher:**
- Premium industries (luxury real estate, high-end B2B)
- Exclusive territories (only client in that city)
- Complex targeting (very specific ICP)
- High-touch service (dedicated manager, custom reports)

### **When to Go Lower:**
- New client (prove value first)
- Long contract (lock them in)
- Referral from existing client
- Testing new industry/market

## ๐จ Red Flags (When NOT to Take Client)

Don't onboard if:
- โ Budget under โน10,000/month (not worth it)
- โ Expects 500 leads for โน5,000 (unrealistic)
- โ "Pay per conversion" (too risky)
- โ Wants leads "tomorrow" (red flag client)
- โ Already worked with 5 agencies (serial churner)

---

## ๐ Your Profit Margin

**Target margins:**
- 40-60% gross margin
- If you're charging โน400/lead, your cost should be โน160-240

**Your costs include:**
- Time (scraping, verification, quality check)
- Tools (scraping software, proxies, databases)
- Ad spend (if using paid ads)
- Overhead (your time, support, etc.)

**Example:**
- You charge: โน12,000/month (30 leads)
- Your costs: โน5,000 (tools, time, ads)
- Your profit: โน7,000 (58% margin) โ
