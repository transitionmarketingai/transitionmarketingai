# üîÑ Complete Operational Workflow

## From Consultation to Lead Delivery - Everything You Need

This is your **complete playbook** for running your lead generation service.

---

## üìä THE COMPLETE WORKFLOW (10 Steps)

```
1. Consultation Request
2. Call & Discovery
3. Fill Onboarding Form
4. Calculate Quotation
5. Send Proposal
6. Client Pays
7. Generate Leads
8. Quality Check
9. Deliver to Client (Dashboard + Email + WhatsApp)
10. Invoice & Repeat
```

Let's break down each step in detail:

---

## üìã STEP 1: Consultation Request
**Where:** Client fills form at `/consultation`
**What Happens:** Request saved to database, you get notified
**Your Action:** Check `/admin/consultations` daily

---

## üìû STEP 2: Call & Discovery
**When:** Within 24 hours
**Duration:** 15-20 minutes
**Goal:** Understand their needs + qualify them

**Call Script:** See `CLIENT_ONBOARDING_WORKFLOW.md`

---

## üìù STEP 3: Fill Onboarding Form
**Where:** `/admin/consultations/[id]/onboard`
**When:** During or immediately after call
**Duration:** 10-15 minutes

**6 Steps in Form:**
1. Basic Info
2. Business Details
3. Current Situation
4. Target Market & ICP
5. Lead Requirements
6. Proposal & Notes

---

## üí∞ STEP 4: Calculate Quotation
**How:** Use the pricing matrix (see `PRICING_CALCULATOR_GUIDE.md`)

### **Quick Calculation Process:**

**Formula:**
```
Base Cost = Industry Rate √ó Quality Level
Source Adjusted = Base Cost √ó Source Factor
Total Before Discount = Source Adjusted √ó Volume
Discount = Total √ó Volume Discount %
Add-ons = Sum of additional services
FINAL = (Total - Discount) + Add-ons
```

**Example (Real Estate, 30 verified leads, AI scraping):**
```
‚Çπ400 (industry rate) √ó 1.0 (AI scraping) √ó 30 leads = ‚Çπ12,000
10% discount (26-50 volume) = -‚Çπ1,200
FINAL = ‚Çπ10,800/month
Cost Per Lead = ‚Çπ360
```

**Fill this in Step 6 of onboarding form:**
- Proposed monthly budget: ‚Çπ10,800
- Proposed leads quota: 30
- Cost per lead: ‚Çπ360 (auto-calculated!)

---

## üìß STEP 5: Send Proposal
