# üîß Localhost Troubleshooting Guide

## Current Status
- ‚úÖ All changes pushed to production (GitHub main branch)
- ‚úÖ Build compiles successfully
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Localhost may need restart

## Quick Fixes for Localhost

### Option 1: Restart Dev Server
```bash
# Kill the current process
pkill -f "next dev"

# Start fresh
npm run dev
```

### Option 2: Use Different Port
```bash
# The server is running on port 3001 (since 3000 is in use)
# Access it at: http://localhost:3001
```

### Option 3: Clear Cache and Restart
```bash
# Clear Next.js cache
rm -rf .next

# Remove node_modules and reinstall (if needed)
npm install

# Start dev server
npm run dev
```
