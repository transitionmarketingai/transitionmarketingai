# 🌐 SITE LINKS & DEPLOYMENT STATUS

## **📍 YOUR WEBSITES:**

### **1. LOCAL DEVELOPMENT:**
```
✅ http://localhost:3010
✅ http://192.168.1.106:3010

Status: ✅ Running
Updated: Just now (latest code)
```

**Note:** Port 3010 (not 3000) because something else is using port 3000.

---

### **2. PRODUCTION (Vercel):**
```
🌍 https://www.transitionmarketingai.com
🌍 https://transitionmarketingai.vercel.app

Status: ⏳ Deploying (should be ready in ~2 more minutes)
Last Deploy: 2 minutes ago (commit 77c0634)
```

---

## **🔍 WHY PRODUCTION STILL SHOWS OLD SITE:**

### **Possible Reasons:**

**1. CDN Cache (Most Likely):**
```
Vercel's edge network caches content globally
Even after deployment, cache might take 5-10 minutes to clear
```

**2. Browser Cache:**
```
Your browser might be showing cached version
Need hard refresh to see new content
```

**3. Deployment Still Processing:**
```
Build might not be fully propagated to all regions yet
```

---

## **✅ HOW TO CHECK IF IT'S UPDATED:**

### **Method 1: Hard Refresh**
```
Mac: Cmd + Shift + R
Windows: Ctrl + Shift + F5
Linux: Ctrl + Shift + R
```

### **Method 2: Incognito/Private Mode**
```
Open new incognito/private window
Visit: www.transitionmarketingai.com
```

### **Method 3: Clear Browser Cache**
```
Chrome: Settings → Privacy → Clear browsing data
Firefox: Settings → Privacy → Clear Data
Safari: Develop → Empty Caches
```

### **Method 4: Check Headers (Developer Tool)**
```
1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Network tab
3. Refresh page
4. Click on first request
5. Check "x-vercel-id" header
6. If it shows recent timestamp → deployed
```

### **Method 5: Add Cache Buster**
```
Visit: https://www.transitionmarketingai.com?v=77c0634

This forces browser to bypass cache
```
