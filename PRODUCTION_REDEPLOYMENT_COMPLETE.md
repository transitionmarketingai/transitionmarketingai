## 🔧 **Issues Fixed in This Deployment:**

### **1. Supabase Cookies Async Issue**
```
Error: Route "/api/analytics/dashboard" used `cookies().get()` 
`cookies()` should be awaited before using its value
```
**Root Cause:** Next.js 15 requires `cookies()` to be awaited  
**Fix:** Updated all API routes to use `await createClient()`  
**Files Updated:** 32 API route files

### **2. Build Cache Issues**
```
Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, open '.next/routes-manifest.json'
```
**Root Cause:** Corrupted Next.js build cache  
**Fix:** Cleared `.next` directory and rebuilt from scratch
