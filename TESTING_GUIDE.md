## üîê Admin Login Setup

### Step 1: Create Admin User in Supabase

You need to create an admin user in Supabase Auth. Here's how:

#### Option A: Using Supabase Dashboard (Recommended)

1. Go to your Supabase project: https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Navigate to **Authentication** ‚Üí **Users**
3. Click **"Add User"** ‚Üí **"Create New User"**
4. Enter the following:
   - **Email**: `admin@transitionmarketingai.com` (or your preferred email)
   - **Password**: Choose a strong password (e.g., `Admin@2024!`)
   - **Auto Confirm User**: ‚úÖ Check this box
5. Click **"Create User"**

#### Option B: Using SQL (Alternative)

1. Go to Supabase **SQL Editor**
2. Run this query (replace email/password):

```sql
-- Create admin user via Supabase Auth
-- Note: You'll need to use Supabase Auth API or Dashboard to create users
-- This is just for reference

-- The admin login checks for emails ending in @transitionmarketingai.com
-- OR the specific email: admin@leadgen.in
```

### Step 2: Admin Login Credentials

**Default Admin Login:**
- **URL**: `https://your-domain.com/admin/login`
- **Email**: `admin@transitionmarketingai.com` (or `admin@leadgen.in`)
- **Password**: (the password you set when creating the user)

**Note**: The admin login route checks for:
- Emails ending with `@transitionmarketingai.com`
