## ✅ **VERIFIED LEAD POLICY**

### **What is a "Verified Lead"?**

A lead is only considered **verified** and delivered when:

#### **For Ad-Generated Leads:**
- ✅ **Inquiry Made** - They filled out a form/inquiry on your ad
- ✅ **Intent Confirmed** - They actively expressed interest
- ✅ **Contact Validated** - Phone/email checked for deliverability
- ✅ **Response Ready** - Lead is ready to be contacted

**Why Ads = Verified:**
- When someone clicks your ad and fills a form, they've shown clear intent
- This is higher quality than scraping because they're actively seeking your service
- Ad leads have 3-5x higher conversion rates than cold leads

#### **For Scraped Leads:**
- ✅ **Phone Verified** - Called and confirmed active/number works
- ✅ **Email Verified** - Email address exists and is deliverable
- ✅ **Business Verified** - Business exists and is active (Google Maps, reviews)
- ✅ **Decision Maker Identified** - Found the right contact person (if applicable)
- ✅ **Industry Match** - Confirmed they match your criteria
- ✅ **Geographic Match** - Located in target area

**Verification Process for Scraped Leads:**
1. **Initial Scraping** → Raw data collected
2. **Phone Verification** → Call test or Truecaller check
3. **Email Verification** → Hunter.io/ZeroBounce validation
4. **Business Verification** → Google Maps API check
5. **Manual Review** → Quality check before delivery
6. **Delivery** → Only verified leads go to dashboard

### **Verification Timeline:**

- **Ad Leads:** Instant (when they submit form = verified)
- **Scraped Leads:** 24-48 hours (verification process before delivery)

### **Quality Guarantee:**

> "We only deliver verified, confirmed leads. If a lead doesn't meet our verification standards, we don't deliver it. Better to deliver 20 verified leads than 50 unverified ones."

## 📊 **PRICING CALCULATOR LOGIC**

### **How to Calculate Custom Pricing:**

```
Base Cost = (Ad Cost + Scraping Cost + Verification Cost) + Margin

Where:
- Ad Cost = CPL × Number of ad leads
- Scraping Cost = ₹50-100 per scraped lead (time + tools)
- Verification Cost = ₹50-150 per lead (depending on tier)
- Margin = 40-60% (depending on volume)
```

### **CPL by Source:**

| Source | CPL | Quality | Best For |
|-------|-----|--------|----------|
| Facebook Lead Ads | ₹300-500 | High intent | Quick quality leads |
| Google Search Ads | ₹400-800 | Highest intent | Top-of-funnel |
| LinkedIn Ads | ₹500-1,000 | B2B, professional | Enterprise clients |
| Google Maps Scraping | ₹50-100 | Medium quality | Volume, cost-effective |
| LinkedIn Scraping | ₹100-200 | Medium-high | B2B leads |
| Manual Research | ₹500-1,000 | Highest quality | Premium plans |

### **Pricing Examples:**

#### **Budget: ₹15,000/month**
```
Option 1: 15 Leads (₹1,000/lead)
- 10 ad leads × ₹400 = ₹4,000
- 5 scraped leads × ₹100 = ₹500
- Verification (15 × ₹150) = ₹2,250
- Margin (40%) = ₹2,750
Total: ₹14,500 → Round to ₹15,000
```

#### **Budget: ₹35,000/month**
```
Option 1: 50 Leads (₹700/lead)
- 35 ad leads × ₹450 = ₹15,750
- 15 scraped leads × ₹100 = ₹1,500
- Verification (50 × ₹120) = ₹6,000
- Margin (45%) = ₹5,400
Total: ₹28,650 → Round to ₹35,000
```

#### **Budget: ₹70,000/month**
```
Option 1: 150 Leads (₹467/lead)
- 75 ad leads × ₹400 = ₹30,000
- 75 scraped leads × ₹80 = ₹6,000 (bulk discount)
- Verification (150 × ₹100) = ₹15,000 (bulk discount)
- Margin (50%) = ₹9,500

## 💬 **HOW TO EXPLAIN TO CLIENTS**

### **Key Talking Points:**

#### **1. Why Only Verified Leads:**
> "We have a strict policy: we only deliver verified, confirmed leads. If a lead doesn't pass our verification process, we don't deliver it. This means:
> 
> - **For ads:** They've already shown intent by filling your form
> - **For scraping:** We verify phone, email, and business before delivery
> 
> Why? Because we want you to succeed. Better to deliver 20 verified leads you can actually convert than 50 unverified leads that waste your time."

#### **2. Why Custom Pricing:**
> "Every business is different. Some need 20 leads/month, others need 200. Some prioritize quality, others need volume. That's why we don't have fixed plans.
> 
> During our consultation, we'll:
> - Understand your budget
> - Assess your needs
> - Create 2-3 custom options for you
> 
> This way, you get exactly what you need, not what we think you need."

#### **3. Lead Mix Explanation:**
> "We use a hybrid approach:
> 
> - **Ads:** When someone clicks your ad and fills a form, they're showing clear intent. Higher quality, higher cost.
> - **Scraping:** We find businesses that match your criteria, then verify them before delivery. More cost-effective, still high quality.
> 
> We balance both based on your budget and needs. Want more quality? We'll increase ad percentage. Need more volume? We'll optimize the scraping mix."
