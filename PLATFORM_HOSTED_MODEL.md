### Landing Page System

**How customers create pages:**

```typescript
// app/dashboard/campaigns/new/page.tsx

export default function CreateCampaign() {
  return (
    <div className="max-w-4xl mx-auto p-8">
      <h1>Create New Campaign</h1>
      
      {/* Step 1: Choose Template */}
      <TemplateSelector 
        onSelect={(template) => setSelectedTemplate(template)}
      />
      
      {/* Step 2: Customize */}
      <CampaignCustomizer 
        template={selectedTemplate}
        onUpdate={(config) => setCampaignConfig(config)}
      />
      
      {/* Step 3: Choose Lead Generation Method */}
      <LeadGenerationSelector>
        <Option value="ai_powered">
          <h3>AI-Powered (Recommended)</h3>
          <p>We run ads and generate leads for you</p>
          <p>Cost: Included in plan + per lead overage</p>
        </Option>
        
        <Option value="self_service">
          <h3>Self-Service</h3>
          <p>You run your own ads to this page</p>
          <p>Cost: Only platform fee ($99/month)</p>
        </Option>
        
        <Option value="organic">
          <h3>Organic/Direct</h3>
          <p>Share the link, no paid ads</p>
          <p>Cost: Only platform fee ($99/month)</p>
        </Option>
      </LeadGenerationSelector>
      
      {/* Step 4: Configure AI Chatbot */}
      <ChatbotConfigurator 
        onUpdate={(config) => setChatbotConfig(config)}
      />
      
      {/* Step 5: Publish */}
      <Button onClick={publishCampaign}>
        Publish Campaign
      </Button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

**Generated landing page:**

```typescript
// app/c/[slug]/page.tsx
// This is the public-facing landing page

export default async function LandingPage({ 
  params 
}: { 
  params: { slug: string } 
}) {
  // Get campaign configuration
  const campaign = await getCampaignBySlug(params.slug);
  
  if (!campaign || !campaign.is_active) {
    return <NotFound />;
  }
  
  return (
    <div className="landing-page" style={{
      '--primary-color': campaign.primary_color
    }}>
      {/* Header */}
      <header>
        {campaign.logo_url && (
          <img src={campaign.logo_url} alt="Logo" />
        )}
      </header>
      
      {/* Hero Section */}
      <section className="hero">
        <h1>{campaign.headline}</h1>
        <p>{campaign.subheadline}</p>
        
        {/* Lead Capture Form */}
        <LeadCaptureForm campaignId={campaign.id} />
      </section>
      
      {/* AI Chatbot Widget */}
      {campaign.chatbot_enabled && (
        <AIChatbotWidget 
          campaignId={campaign.id}
          greeting={campaign.chatbot_greeting}
          questions={campaign.qualification_questions}
        />
      )}
      
      {/* Additional sections from template */}
      <RenderTemplate template={campaign.template} />
      
      {/* Tracking */}
      <TrackingPixel campaignId={campaign.id} />
    </div>
  );
}
```

### AI Chatbot on Landing Pages

```typescript
// components/AIChatbotWidget.tsx

export function AIChatbotWidget({ 
  campaignId, 
  greeting,
  questions 
}: {
  campaignId: string;
  greeting: string;
  questions: any[];
}) {
  const [isOpen, setIsOpen] = useState(false);
  const [messages, setMessages] = useState([
    { role: 'assistant', content: greeting }
  ]);
  
  async function handleSendMessage(message: string) {
    // Add user message
    setMessages(prev => [...prev, { role: 'user', content: message }]);
    
    // Call AI API
    const response = await fetch('/api/chat/landing', {
      method: 'POST',
      body: JSON.stringify({
        campaignId,
        message,
        conversationHistory: messages
      })
    });
    
    const { reply, isQualified, leadId } = await response.json();
    
    // Add AI response
    setMessages(prev => [...prev, { role: 'assistant', content: reply }]);
    
    // If qualified, show success message
    if (isQualified) {
      setMessages(prev => [...prev, {
        role: 'assistant',
        content: 'Thanks! Someone will be in touch shortly. Feel free to ask any other questions!'
      }]);
    }
  }
  
  return (
    <>
      {/* Chat bubble button */}
      <button 
        onClick={() => setIsOpen(true)}
        className="fixed bottom-4 right-4 bg-primary text-white rounded-full p-4"
      >
        üí¨ Chat with us
      </button>
      
      {/* Chat window */}
      {isOpen && (
        <div className="fixed bottom-20 right-4 w-96 h-[600px] bg-white rounded-lg shadow-2xl">
          <ChatWindow 
            messages={messages}
            onSendMessage={handleSendMessage}
          />
        </div>
      )}
    </>
  );
}
```

### API: Chat Endpoint for Landing Pages

```typescript
// app/api/chat/landing/route.ts

export async function POST(req: Request) {
  const { campaignId, message, conversationHistory } = await req.json();
  
  // Get campaign configuration
  const campaign = await getCampaign(campaignId);
  
  // Get visitor ID (from cookie or create new)
  const visitorId = getOrCreateVisitorId();
  
  // Generate AI response
  const systemPrompt = `You are a helpful assistant for ${campaign.name}.
  Your goal is to:
  1. Engage the visitor in a friendly conversation
  2. Ask qualifying questions: ${JSON.stringify(campaign.qualification_questions)}
  3. Collect their name, email, and phone number naturally
  4. Determine if they're a good fit
  
  Be conversational and helpful. Don't be pushy.`;
  
  const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({
    model: 'gpt-4-turbo',
    messages: [
      { role: 'system', content: systemPrompt },
      ...conversationHistory,
      { role: 'user', content: message }
    ]
  });
  
  const reply = response.choices[0].message.content;
  
  // Check if lead is qualified
  const isQualified = await checkIfQualified(conversationHistory, reply);
  
  let leadId = null;
  if (isQualified) {
    // Extract contact information
    const contactInfo = await extractContactInfo(conversationHistory);
    
    // Create lead
    const lead = await createLead({
      campaign_id: campaignId,
      user_id: campaign.user_id,
      name: contactInfo.name,
      email: contactInfo.email,
      phone: contactInfo.phone,
      source: campaign.generation_method,
      quality_score: await calculateQualityScore(conversationHistory),
      conversation_transcript: conversationHistory
    });
    
    leadId = lead.id;
    
    // Notify customer
    await notifyCustomer(campaign.user_id, lead.id);
    
    // Check if should charge for this lead
    await handleLeadBilling(campaign.user_id, lead.id);
  }
  
  // Save conversation
  await saveConversation({
    campaignId,
    visitorId,
    message,
    reply
  });
  
  return Response.json({ 
    reply, 
    isQualified,
    leadId 
  });
}
```

## üìä LEAD GENERATION METHODS

### Method 1: AI-Powered (You Run Ads)

**How it works:**

1. **Customer sets goal**: "I want 50 leads this month"

2. **You calculate budget needed**:
   ```
   Target: 50 leads
   Cost per lead: $30 (average)
   Ad spend needed: $1,500
   
   Customer pays: $299/month (includes 30 leads)
   Extra 20 leads √ó $20 = $400
   Total customer pays: $699
   
   You spend on ads: $1,500
   You receive from customer: $699
   Your net cost: -$801
   
   BUT, you charge based on tier:
   - If on Growth plan, they get 30 included
   - They pay $20 each for next 20 = $400
   - So they pay $699 total
   - Your ad spend: $1,500
   - You need to make this profitable
   ```

**Wait, this doesn't work!** Let me recalculate...

**BETTER PRICING** for AI-Powered:

```
AI-Powered Plan: $499/month
Includes:
  - 30 AI-generated leads
  - You spend ~$900 on ads (at $30/lead)
  - Your cost: $900
  - Your revenue: $499
  - You subsidize: -$401

Additional leads: $35 each
  - Cost to generate: $30
  - You charge: $35
  - Profit: $5 per lead

OR...
```

**BETTER MODEL**: 

```
AI-Powered Plan: $299/month base fee
Lead pricing:
  - $40 per lead (you spend $30, profit $10)
  - No included leads
  - Or 10 included leads, then $40 each extra

Customer pays:
  - Base: $299
  - 50 leads √ó $40 = $2,000
  - Total: $2,299/month

Your costs:
  - Ad spend: $1,500 (50 leads √ó $30)
  - Platform: $5
  - Total: $1,505

Your profit: $794 (35% margin)
```

**OR SIMPLEST**:

```
AI-Powered tiers:

Starter: $499/month
  - 20 leads included
  - Your cost: $600 ad spend
  - You subsidize to acquire customer

Growth: $999/month ‚≠ê
  - 50 leads included
  - Your cost: $1,500 ad spend
  - You subsidize to acquire customer
  - Extra leads: $25 each

Scale: $1,999/month
  - 100 leads included
  - Your cost: $3,000 ad spend
  - You subsidize initially
  - Extra leads: $20 each

Strategy: You take a hit initially to acquire customers,
make it back on extras and long-term retention.
```

### Method 2: Self-Service (They Run Ads)

**How it works:**

1. Customer creates landing page on your platform
2. Gets URL: `yourplatform.com/c/their-slug`
3. They run their own Google/Meta ads
4. Ads point to that URL
5. Your AI chatbot qualifies visitors
6. Leads appear in their dashboard
7. They manage everything on your platform

**Pricing:**
```
Self-Service Plan: $99/month
  - Unlimited leads (they generate)
  - Your cost: $5/month
  - Your profit: $94/month (94% margin!)
```

**This is PURE SAAS!** You just provide the tools.

### Method 3: Organic/Direct

**How it works:**

1. Customer shares their landing page link
2. On social media, email signature, business cards, etc.
3. People click the link
4. Land on your platform
5. AI chatbot qualifies them
6. Leads captured

**Pricing:**
```
Same as Self-Service: $99/month
  - Your cost: $5
  - Your profit: $94 (94% margin!)
```
