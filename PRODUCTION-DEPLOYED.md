3. See the latest workflow run

### **Option 3: Wait for Email**

## ⏱️ **Expected Timeline:**

```
✅ Code pushed to GitHub     (NOW - Complete)
⏳ Vercel detects changes    (0-30 seconds)
⏳ Build starts              (30 seconds)
⏳ Building...               (2-4 minutes)
⏳ Deployment                (30 seconds)
✅ Live on production        (Total: ~3-5 minutes)
```

---

## 🌍 **Your Production URLs:**

Once deployed, your site will be live at:

- **Primary:** https://transitionmarketingai.vercel.app
- **Custom Domain:** (if configured in Vercel)

**New Pages Added:**
- `/credits` - Credit purchase page
- `/dashboard` - Updated with all fixes
- All API routes updated

---

## ⚠️ **IMPORTANT: Database Setup Required**

**Your production site will work, but you MUST run these SQL scripts in Supabase for full functionality:**

### **Step 1: Go to Supabase Dashboard**
https://app.supabase.com → Your Project → SQL Editor

### **Step 2: Run These 2 Scripts (In Order)**

**Script 1: `database-fix-final.sql`**
```sql
ALTER TABLE leads ALTER COLUMN name DROP NOT NULL;
UPDATE leads SET name = contact_name WHERE name IS NULL;
ALTER TABLE leads ALTER COLUMN name SET NOT NULL;
NOTIFY pgrst, 'reload schema';
```

**Script 2: `new-database-tables.sql`**  
(This creates `unlocked_leads`, `saved_searches` tables and functions)

**Why This Is Critical:**
- ❌ Without these: Unlock feature won't work
- ❌ Without these: Unlocked leads won't persist
- ✅ With these: Everything works perfectly

---

## 🧪 **Testing Production:**

Once deployed (check your email or Vercel dashboard):

### **1. Test Homepage**
```
Visit: https://your-domain.com

- Should see updated meta description
```

### **2. Test Dashboard**
```
Visit: https://your-domain.com/dashboard
Sign In → Go to "AI Leads" section

```

### **3. Test Credit Purchase**
```
Visit: https://your-domain.com/credits

- Purchase button should work (simulated payment)
```

### **4. Test Lead Unlock**
```
Dashboard → AI Leads → Generate Leads
- Try to unlock a lead
- Credits should decrease by 5
- Lead should appear in "My Unlocked Leads"
- If credits < 5, should show error
```
