# üîß Gmail App Password - Alternative Solutions

## Issue: Can't Find App Passwords

This happens if:
- 2-Step Verification is not fully enabled
- Using a Workspace/Organization account
- Account type doesn't support app passwords

## Solution 1: Direct Link to App Passwords

Try this direct link:
**https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords**

If it says "App passwords aren't available", continue to Solution 2.

## Solution 2: Use "Less Secure App Access" (Not Recommended)

**‚ö†Ô∏è This is less secure and Google is phasing it out.**
Only use if app passwords aren't available.

1. Go to: https://myaccount.google.com/lesssecureapps
2. Turn ON "Allow less secure apps"
3. Use your regular Gmail password (not app password)

**Add to Vercel:**
```
SMTP_USER = your-email@gmail.com
SMTP_PASSWORD = your-regular-gmail-password
```

## Solution 3: Use Resend (Recommended Alternative)

**Better option if Gmail doesn't work!**

1. Sign up: https://resend.com (free tier: 3,000 emails/month)
2. Get API key from dashboard
3. Add to Vercel:
   ```
   RESEND_API_KEY=re_xxxxxxxxxxxxx
   RESEND_FROM=noreply@transitionmarketingai.com
   ```
4. I'll update the code to use Resend instead

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ Easier setup (just API key)
- ‚úÖ Better deliverability
- ‚úÖ Higher limits (3,000/month free)
- ‚úÖ No Gmail restrictions
