---

## 🎯 Step 1: Add Vercel Environment Variables (3 minutes)

### **Option A: Via Vercel Dashboard (Easiest)**

1. Go to: **https://vercel.com/dashboard**
2. Select your project: **TransitionMarketingAI**
3. Click **Settings** (top navigation)
4. Click **Environment Variables** (left sidebar)
5. Add these **TWO** variables:

#### Variable 1:
```
Name: NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL
Value: https://veeylzzmymqqfecnlnqr.supabase.co
Environment: Production, Preview, Development (select all)
```
Click **"Save"**

#### Variable 2:
```
Name: NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
Value: eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZSIsInJlZiI6InZlZXlsenpteW1xcWZlY25sbnFyIiwicm9sZSI6ImFub24iLCJpYXQiOjE3NTkyMzg3ODEsImV4cCI6MjA3NDgxNDc4MX0.w3N3YvKYJYtmcxgSpRnz-JGTbfyJNZHbeEMvkw0gFOI
Environment: Production, Preview, Development (select all)
```
Click **"Save"**

---

## 🎯 Step 2: Redeploy to Production (2 minutes)

1. Still in Vercel Dashboard, click **Deployments** (top navigation)
2. Find the latest deployment (should be at the top)
3. Click the **3 dots (•••)** on the right side
4. Click **"Redeploy"**
5. Confirm the redeploy
6. Wait ~2 minutes for deployment to complete

---

## 🎯 Step 3: Restart Local Development Server (30 seconds)

Your local `.env.local` is already configured! Just restart:

```bash
# In your terminal:
# Press Ctrl+C to stop the current server
# Then run:
npm run dev
```

---

## 🧪 Step 4: Test Everything

### **Test Local (http://localhost:3000)**

1. **Demo Mode**:
   - Go to: http://localhost:3000/login?demo=true
   - Should see demo dashboard immediately
   - ✅ This still works (uses localStorage)

2. **Real Signup**:
   - Go to: http://localhost:3000/signup
   - Enter your email and create password
   - Check your email for verification link
   - Click verification link
   - Complete onboarding
   - Access dashboard
   - ✅ Data now saves to Supabase!

### **Test Production (https://transitionmarketingai.com)**

After Vercel deployment completes (~2 minutes):

1. **Demo Mode**:
   - Go to: https://transitionmarketingai.com/login?demo=true
   - Should work immediately

2. **Real Signup**:
   - Go to: https://transitionmarketingai.com/signup
   - Create account with real email
   - Verify email
   - Complete onboarding
   - Use dashboard!

## 🎉 What's Working Now:

### **Before (Yesterday)**
❌ Signup didn't connect to database  
❌ Demo mode broke on navigation  
❌ No real user data storage  
❌ Authentication incomplete  

### **After (Now)**
✅ **Full Authentication**: Supabase Auth with email verification  
✅ **Real User Signups**: Data persists in database  
✅ **Onboarding Flow**: Saves business info to `customers` table  
✅ **Demo Mode**: Works perfectly (persisted with cookies)  
✅ **Dashboard**: Can load real data from Supabase  
✅ **Subscription Plans**: 4 plans ready (Starter, Growth, Professional, Enterprise)  
✅ **Row Level Security**: Users can only see their own data

## 📊 Your Subscription Plans (Ready to Use!)

| Plan | Price | Leads/Month | Features |

## 🔍 How to Verify Everything Works

### **Check Supabase Tables Have Data**

1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/veeylzzmymqqfecnlnqr
2. Click **Table Editor**
3. After you sign up, check these tables:
   - **`customers`** - Should have your business info
   - **`subscription_plans`** - Should have 4 plans
   - **Auth → Users** - Should show your email

---

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### **Issue: "Failed to sign up"**
**Fix**: Check Vercel environment variables are saved and redeployed

### **Issue: "No subscription plans available"**
**Fix**: Run this in Supabase SQL Editor:
```sql
SELECT * FROM subscription_plans;
```
You should see 4 rows. If empty, re-run the seed data section from `RUN_THIS_COMPLETE.sql`

### **Issue: Email verification link doesn't work**
**Fix**: 
1. Go to Supabase → Authentication → URL Configuration
2. Set **Site URL**: `https://transitionmarketingai.com`
3. Add **Redirect URLs**: `https://transitionmarketingai.com/*`

### **Issue: Local server still shows "getaddrinfo ENOTFOUND"**
**Fix**: 
1. Verify `.env.local` file exists in project root
2. Restart dev server (Ctrl+C, then `npm run dev`)
