# Lead Quality Guarantee & Risk Management Policy

## üéØ THE TWO PROBLEMS

### Problem 1: Customer unhappy with lead quality
**Scenario**: Customer says "These leads are not good, I can't reach them" or "They're not interested"

### Problem 2: Can't deliver promised quota
**Scenario**: Customer paid for 50 leads/month but you only generated 30 leads

---

## ‚úÖ SOLUTION 1: LEAD QUALITY GUARANTEE (Copy HomeAdvisor Model)

### What Makes a "Valid Lead"?

Define EXACTLY what qualifies as a valid lead:

**Valid Lead Criteria** (Customer gets charged):
1. ‚úÖ Contact information is accurate (phone/email works)
2. ‚úÖ Lead matches target criteria (location, budget, timeline)
3. ‚úÖ Lead expressed genuine interest (filled form, engaged with chatbot)
4. ‚úÖ Lead is reachable (not a fake number, responds to messages)
5. ‚úÖ Lead submitted within last 24-48 hours (fresh)
6. ‚úÖ Lead is not a duplicate (same person within 90 days)

**Invalid Lead** (Customer gets refund/credit):
1. ‚ùå Phone number doesn't work / wrong number
2. ‚ùå Email bounces back
3. ‚ùå Lead says "I never filled this form" (fraud)
4. ‚ùå Lead is completely outside target criteria
5. ‚ùå Duplicate lead (sent to same customer before)
6. ‚ùå Lead is from competitor trying to waste time

---

## üí∞ REFUND & CREDIT POLICY

### Money-Back Guarantee (30 Days)

**Copy Thumbtack's Policy**:

## üìä IMPLEMENTATION IN DATABASE

Add to database schema:

```sql
-- Lead Disputes
CREATE TABLE lead_disputes (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  
  customer_id UUID REFERENCES customers(id),
  lead_id UUID REFERENCES leads(id),
  
  -- Dispute Details
  dispute_reason TEXT NOT NULL, 
  -- 'phone_invalid', 'email_invalid', 'not_interested', 
  -- 'wrong_criteria', 'duplicate', 'fraud', 'no_response', 'other'
  
  dispute_description TEXT,
  evidence JSONB, -- Screenshots, conversation logs, etc.
  
  -- Resolution
  status TEXT DEFAULT 'pending', -- 'pending', 'approved', 'rejected', 'resolved'
  resolution TEXT,
  resolved_by UUID, -- Admin who resolved
  resolved_at TIMESTAMP,
  
  -- Action Taken
  credit_amount INTEGER, -- In paise
  credit_issued BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,

  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Lead Credits
CREATE TABLE lead_credits (

  customer_id UUID REFERENCES customers(id),
  
  -- Credit Details

-- Update subscriptions table to track credits
ALTER TABLE subscriptions ADD COLUMN available_credits INTEGER DEFAULT 0;
```

## üéØ SOLUTION 2: QUOTA FULFILLMENT GUARANTEE

### What if you can't deliver 50 leads?

**Tiered Approach** (Best Practice):

### Option A: Prorated Pricing (Recommended)

**How it works**:
```
Customer Plan: Growth (‚Çπ14,999/month for 50 leads)
Price per lead: ‚Çπ14,999 √∑ 50 = ‚Çπ299.98 per lead

Month 1:
- Delivered: 35 leads only
- Charge: 35 √ó ‚Çπ300 = ‚Çπ10,500 (instead of ‚Çπ14,999)
- Savings to customer: ‚Çπ4,499

Month 2:
- Delivered: 52 leads
- Included: 50 leads = ‚Çπ14,999
- Overage: 2 leads √ó ‚Çπ400 = ‚Çπ800
- Total charge: ‚Çπ15,799
```

**Pros**:
- Fair to customer (pay for what you get)
- Reduces refund requests
- Builds trust

**Cons**:
- Unpredictable revenue
- Need good tracking system

---

### Option B: Rollover System (Like Mobile Data Plans)

**How it works**:
```
Customer Plan: Growth (50 leads/month)

Month 1:
- Quota: 50 leads
- Delivered: 35 leads
- Rollover to next month: 15 leads

Month 2:
- Base quota: 50 leads
- Rollover: +15 leads
- Total available: 65 leads
- Delivered: 58 leads
- Rollover to next month: 7 leads

Rollover Rules:
- Max rollover: 50% of monthly quota (25 leads for Growth plan)
- Expires after 2 months
- Only for unused quota, not purchased overages
```

**Pros**:
- Keeps monthly revenue stable
- Customer feels they get value
- Less refund pressure

**Cons**:
- Some months you need to deliver more
- Tracking complexity

---

### Option C: Minimum Guarantee + Prorated (BEST!)

**Combine both approaches**:

```
Growth Plan: ‚Çπ14,999/month
Minimum Guarantee: 30 leads (60% of quota)
Full Quota: 50 leads

Scenario 1: Delivered 45 leads
- Customer charged: Full ‚Çπ14,999 ‚úì
- Reason: Above minimum guarantee
- Customer happy: Got 90% of quota

Scenario 2: Delivered 25 leads (below minimum)
- Option A: Prorated charge (25 √ó ‚Çπ300 = ‚Çπ7,500)
- Option B: Full charge but 25 lead credit for next month
- Option C: Refund ‚Çπ7,500 + apologize + offer goodwill credit

Scenario 3: Delivered 55 leads
- Included: 50 leads = ‚Çπ14,999
- Bonus: 5 extra leads (free! builds goodwill)
- Or charge: 5 √ó ‚Çπ400 = ‚Çπ2,000
```

**This is what I recommend** ‚≠ê

## üõ°Ô∏è RISK MITIGATION STRATEGIES

### For YOU (Platform Owner):

### 1. **Start Conservative**

```
Don't overpromise!

Instead of:
‚ùå "Get 50 leads guaranteed!"

Say:
‚úÖ "Get UP TO 50 qualified leads per month"
‚úÖ "Target: 50 leads (minimum 30 guaranteed)"
‚úÖ "Average: 45-55 leads per month"

Set expectations right:
- "Results may vary by location and industry"
- "Lead volume depends on market demand"
- "We optimize campaigns for quality over quantity"
```

### 2. **Build Buffer Into Pricing**

```
Don't price at exact cost!

Your cost per lead: ‚Çπ280
Don't charge: ‚Çπ280 √ó 50 = ‚Çπ14,000

Charge: ‚Çπ14,999 (buffer of ‚Çπ999)

This ‚Çπ999 buffer covers:
- Lead disputes and refunds
- Months when you deliver >50 leads
- Quality variations
- Customer acquisition cost
```

### 3. **Quality Over Quantity**

```
Better to:
‚úÖ Deliver 35 GREAT leads
Than:
‚ùå Deliver 50 mediocre leads

Why?
- Customer converts more = stays longer
- Less disputes = less headache
- Better testimonials = easier sales
- Higher LTV = more profitable
```

### 4. **Transparent Dashboard**

Show customers EXACTLY what they're getting:

```
Dashboard should show:

This Month:
‚úì 32 leads delivered (64% of quota)
‚úì Average quality score: 78/100
‚úì Your contact rate: 88% (28 of 32 contacted)
‚úì Conversion rate: 12% (4 customers closed)

Lead Status:
‚úì 28 contacted
‚úì 4 converted to customers
‚úì 0 disputed
‚úì 18 remaining quota

Campaign Performance:
‚úì Facebook: 20 leads (avg quality: 82)
‚úì Google: 12 leads (avg quality: 75)
‚úì Cost per lead: ‚Çπ295
```

This transparency builds trust!

### 5. **Proactive Communication**

**If having a bad month**:

```
Email/WhatsApp to customer (Day 20 of month):

"Hi [Name],

Quick update on your campaign this month:

‚úì 22 leads delivered so far (target: 50)
‚ö†Ô∏è We're seeing lower-than-expected response rates

Here's what we're doing:
‚Ä¢ Adjusted targeting to focus on higher-intent audiences
‚Ä¢ Testing new ad creatives
‚Ä¢ Increased daily budget by 20%

Expected by month-end: 38-42 leads

If we don't hit 30 leads (our minimum guarantee), you'll get:
‚Ä¢ Prorated billing, OR
‚Ä¢ Rollover credits for next month

Questions? Reply to this message or call: [number]

Best,
[Your Team]"
```

**This proactive approach**:
- Shows you care
- Manages expectations
- Reduces disputes
- Builds trust

---

## üí° BEST PRACTICE: HYBRID APPROACH

### What I Recommend:

**Tier Structure With Guarantees**:

```
STARTER (‚Çπ7,999/month):
‚Ä¢ Target: 20 leads
‚Ä¢ Minimum Guarantee: 12 leads (60%)
‚Ä¢ If <12: Prorated billing
‚Ä¢ If 12-20: Full charge, unused rollover
‚Ä¢ If >20: Free bonus (goodwill)

GROWTH (‚Çπ14,999/month):
‚Ä¢ Target: 50 leads
‚Ä¢ Minimum Guarantee: 30 leads (60%)
‚Ä¢ If <30: Prorated billing OR full credit next month
‚Ä¢ If 30-50: Full charge, unused rollover (max 25)
‚Ä¢ If >50: First 5 extra free, then ‚Çπ400 each

PROFESSIONAL (‚Çπ29,999/month):
‚Ä¢ Target: 120 leads
‚Ä¢ Minimum Guarantee: 75 leads (62.5%)
‚Ä¢ If <75: Prorated + ‚Çπ5,000 goodwill credit
‚Ä¢ If 75-120: Full charge, unused rollover (max 60)
‚Ä¢ If >120: First 10 extra free, then ‚Çπ350 each
```

---

## üìä FINANCIAL IMPACT

### Scenario Analysis:

**Assume 100 customers on Growth plan (‚Çπ14,999/month)**

**Scenario 1: Perfect Execution**
```
All customers get 50 leads:
Revenue: 100 √ó ‚Çπ14,999 = ‚Çπ14,99,900/month
Cost: 100 √ó 50 √ó ‚Çπ280 = ‚Çπ14,00,000
Gross Profit: ‚Çπ99,900 (6.7% margin)
```

**Scenario 2: 80% Delivery Rate**
```
Average delivery: 40 leads per customer

With Prorated Billing:
Revenue: 100 √ó 40 √ó ‚Çπ300 = ‚Çπ12,00,000
Cost: 100 √ó 40 √ó ‚Çπ280 = ‚Çπ11,20,000
Gross Profit: ‚Çπ80,000 (6.7% margin)

With Rollover System:
Revenue: 100 √ó ‚Çπ14,999 = ‚Çπ14,99,900 (full)
Cost: ‚Çπ11,20,000
But owe: 1,000 leads next month (need to deliver extra)
```

**Scenario 3: Quality Issues (10% dispute rate)**
```
Delivered: 5,000 leads to 100 customers
Disputed: 500 leads (10%)
Credits issued: 500 √ó ‚Çπ300 = ‚Çπ1,50,000

Revenue: ‚Çπ14,99,900
Cost: ‚Çπ14,00,000
Credits: -‚Çπ1,50,000
Net: -‚Çπ50,100 (LOSS!)

This is why quality matters!
```
