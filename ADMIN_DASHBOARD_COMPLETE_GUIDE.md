## üí∞ How Pricing Works

### **Quick Reference**

**Base Rates (Verified Leads):**
| Industry | Cost/Lead |
|----------|-----------|
| Real Estate | ‚Çπ400 |
| Healthcare | ‚Çπ500 |
| IT Services | ‚Çπ350 |
| Manufacturing | ‚Çπ450 |
| Financial Services | ‚Çπ550 |
| Education | ‚Çπ300 |
| E-commerce | ‚Çπ250 |

**Volume Discounts:**
- 26-50 leads: 10% off
- 51-100 leads: 15% off
- 101-200 leads: 20% off
- 200+ leads: 25% off

**Source Multipliers:**
- AI Scraping: 1.0x (base price)
- Facebook Ads: 1.5x
- Google Ads: 1.8x
- LinkedIn: 2.0x

**Calculation Formula:**
```
Base Cost √ó Source Factor √ó Volume - Discount + Add-ons = Final Price
```

**Example:**
```
Real Estate client wants 30 verified leads via AI scraping

‚Çπ400 (base) √ó 1.0 (AI) √ó 30 leads = ‚Çπ12,000
10% discount (26-50 range) = -‚Çπ1,200
Final = ‚Çπ10,800/month (‚Çπ360/lead)
```

## ü§ñ How to Get Leads for Clients

### **Method 1: AI Web Scraping** (Recommended for most clients)

**When to use:**
- Local businesses (restaurants, doctors, agents)
- B2B companies
- Any directory-based industry

**Tools:**
- Apify - Google Maps, websites
- PhantomBuster - LinkedIn, social media

**Process:**
1. Define target (from client onboarding form)
2. Set up scraper with filters
3. Run overnight (1-6 hours)
4. Export CSV
5. Verify contacts (phone + email)
6. Quality score each lead
7. Upload to client dashboard

**Cost Example:**
- Generate 500 leads
- Verification: ‚Çπ200 (emails) + ‚Çπ250 (phones) = ‚Çπ450
- Your cost per lead: ~‚Çπ0.90
- You charge: ‚Çπ360/lead
- **Profit margin: 99.7%!** (on scraping, before time cost)

**Real Cost Including Time:**
- Tools: ‚Çπ5,000/month
- Your time: 5 hours/week
- Can serve: 10-15 clients
- Revenue: ‚Çπ1,50,000-2,25,000/month
- **Profit after tools: ‚Çπ1,45,000-2,20,000/month**

---

### **Method 2: Facebook/Google Ads** (Premium clients)

**When to use:**
- High-budget clients (‚Çπ20,000+ monthly)
- Competitive industries
- Need high-intent leads (people actively searching)

**Setup:**
1. Client gives you access to their ad account (Meta/Google)
2. You create lead generation campaigns
3. Set up lead forms or landing pages
4. Leads fill forms

**Recommended for most clients:**

## üí° Pro Tips

### **Pricing Psychology**
1. **Anchor high, then discount**
   - "Normally ‚Çπ15,000, but for you ‚Çπ12,000"
2. **Compare to alternatives**
   - "That's like hiring 1 salesperson vs getting 50 leads"
3. **Show ROI**
   - "If even 5% convert, that's ‚ÇπXXX revenue for you"

### **Lead Quality**
1. **Always verify before delivery**
   - Never send unverified leads
   - Your reputation depends on quality
2. **Set expectations upfront**
   - "90% of leads will have active phone numbers"
   - "Not all will convert, but all will be verified"
3. **Offer replacements**
   - "Any bad lead gets replaced for free"

### **Client Retention**
1. **Monthly check-in calls**
   - "How are the leads working out?"
   - "Any adjustments needed?"
2. **Show value**
   - "You got 30 leads, did any convert?"
   - Share success stories from other clients
3. **Ask for referrals**
   - "Know anyone else who needs leads?"
   - Offer referral discount
