# 🔧 DEPLOYMENT FIXES COMPLETE!

## ✅ **Issue Resolved: Vercel Build Errors Fixed**

The Vercel deployment was failing due to two critical issues that have now been resolved:

---

## 🐛 **Problems Fixed:**

### **1. Duplicate Import Error**
```
Error: Identifier 'Tabs' has already been declared
```
**File:** `src/app/dashboard/leads/page.tsx`  
**Issue:** Duplicate import of `Tabs` components on lines 8 and 34  
**Fix:** Removed duplicate import statement

### **2. Razorpay Initialization Error**
```
Error: `key_id` or `oauthToken` is mandatory
```
**Files:** Multiple payment API routes  
**Issue:** Razorpay was being initialized at module level during build time when environment variables aren't available  
**Fix:** Moved Razorpay initialization inside functions

---

## 🔧 **Files Modified:**

### **1. `src/app/dashboard/leads/page.tsx`**
- ✅ Removed duplicate `Tabs` import
- ✅ Build now compiles successfully

### **2. `src/app/api/payments/create-subscription/route.ts`**
- ✅ Moved Razorpay initialization inside POST function
- ✅ Prevents build-time environment variable errors

### **3. `src/app/api/subscriptions/create/route.ts`**
- ✅ Moved Razorpay initialization inside POST function
- ✅ Prevents build-time environment variable errors

### **4. `src/lib/razorpay/client.ts`**
- ✅ Created `getRazorpayInstance()` function
- ✅ Updated all functions to use lazy initialization
- ✅ Prevents module-level Razorpay instantiation

---

## ✅ **Build Status:**

```bash
npm run build
✓ Compiled successfully in 5.6s
✓ Collecting page data 
✓ Generating static pages (83/83)
✓ Finalizing page optimization
```

**Result:** ✅ **BUILD SUCCESSFUL**

## 🎉 **Success Metrics:**

### **Before Fix:**
- ❌ Build failed with webpack errors
- ❌ Duplicate import declarations
- ❌ Razorpay initialization errors
- ❌ Vercel deployment failed

### **After Fix:**
- ✅ Build compiles successfully
- ✅ All imports resolved correctly
- ✅ Razorpay lazy initialization working
- ✅ Vercel deployment triggered successfully

---

## 🔍 **Technical Details:**

### **Root Cause Analysis:**
1. **Duplicate Imports:** Copy-paste error during AI feature integration

### **Solution Strategy:**
1. **Import Cleanup:** Removed duplicate import statements
2. **Lazy Initialization:** Moved Razorpay instantiation inside functions
3. **Environment Safety:** Added conditional checks for environment variables
