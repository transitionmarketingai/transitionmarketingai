  company_name TEXT NOT NULL,
  industry TEXT,
  location TEXT,
  quality_score INTEGER, -- 0-100
  locked BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE,
  phone TEXT, -- encrypted until unlocked
  email TEXT, -- encrypted until unlocked
  found_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  unlocked_at TIMESTAMP,
  credits_cost INTEGER DEFAULT 10
);

-- Credits table
CREATE TABLE customer_credits (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  customer_id UUID REFERENCES customers(id),
  balance INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Credit transactions
CREATE TABLE credit_transactions (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  customer_id UUID REFERENCES customers(id),
  amount INTEGER, -- positive = purchase, negative = spent
  transaction_type TEXT, -- 'purchase', 'unlock_lead', 'refund'
  description TEXT,
  prospect_id UUID REFERENCES prospects(id), -- if spent on prospect
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Call logs
CREATE TABLE call_logs (

  phone_number TEXT,
  duration_seconds INTEGER,
  status TEXT, -- 'answered', 'missed', 'voicemail', 'busy'

## 🎯 Summary:

### **The New Flow is:**
1. **AI finds** → Prospects (locked 🔒)
2. **User browses** → Sees preview, quality score
3. **User unlocks** → Spends credits
4. **Contact revealed** → Moves to "My Leads"
5. **User contacts** → Call, email, WhatsApp
6. **Track & convert** → Pipeline management

This matches successful platforms like:
- **LinkedIn Sales Navigator** (credits to see contact info)
- **Hunter.io** (credits to reveal emails)
- **Apollo.io** (credits for phone numbers)

**Clear, simple, profitable!** 🚀
