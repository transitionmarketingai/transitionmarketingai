## ðŸŽ¯ HOW TO GET LEADS (COMPLETE ANSWER)

You asked: **"How do we work on getting the leads? Is it only AI-based scraping? Will we also use ads? How do we verify?"**

### **ANSWER:**

**You can use BOTH AI scraping AND ads!** Here's how:

---

### **Option 1: AI Web Scraping** (Most Common)

**Tools:**
- **Apify** (â‚¹2,000-5,000/month) - Google Maps, websites
- **PhantomBuster** (â‚¹3,000-8,000/month) - LinkedIn, social
- **Hunter.io** (â‚¹2,500/month) - Email verification

**Process:**
1. Client wants Real Estate leads in Mumbai
2. You set up Apify Google Maps scraper
3. Search: "real estate agent Mumbai"
4. Scraper runs overnight â†’ Gets 500-1000 leads
5. Export CSV with: Name, phone, email, address
6. Verify emails with Hunter.io (â‚¹200 cost)
7. Verify phones with Truecaller API (â‚¹250 cost)
8. Quality score each lead (0-100)
9. Keep best 30 leads (or client's quota)
10. Upload to client dashboard

**Your Cost:** â‚¹450 for verification
**You Charge:** â‚¹10,800 (30 leads Ã— â‚¹360)
**Your Profit:** â‚¹10,350 (before tool costs & time)

**With monthly tool costs:**
- Revenue from 1 client: â‚¹10,800
- Tool costs (serving 10 clients): â‚¹500/client
- Net profit per client: â‚¹10,300
- **10 clients = â‚¹1,03,000/month profit!**

---

### **Option 2: Facebook/Google Ads** (Premium Clients)

**When to use:**
- Client has big budget (â‚¹20,000+ monthly)
- Needs high-intent leads (people actively searching)
- Competitive industry

**Process:**
1. Client gives you access to their Meta/Google Ads account
2. You create lead generation campaigns
3. Set up lead forms (Facebook Lead Ads or Google Lead Form Extensions)
4. People see ads â†’ Fill forms â†’ You get their info
5. Export leads weekly
6. Verify contacts
7. Upload to client dashboard

**Cost Structure:**
- Client pays you: â‚¹600/lead
- Ad platform takes (CPC/CPL): â‚¹300/lead
- Your margin: â‚¹300/lead

**Example:**
- 50 leads/month
- Client pays: â‚¹30,000
- Ad spend: â‚¹15,000 (goes to Facebook/Google)
- Your profit: â‚¹15,000

**Important:** Always run ads in **client's** ad account, not yours!
- They own the data
- Full transparency
- You just manage the campaigns

---

### **Option 3: Hybrid** (RECOMMENDED!)

**Best approach for most clients:**
- Week 1-2: AI scraping (fast, cheap, build volume)
- Week 3-4: Facebook Ads (higher quality, prove value)
- Result: 70% scraping + 30% ads

**Example (50 leads/month):**
- 35 leads from AI scraping (â‚¹0.90 cost each) = â‚¹31.50
- 15 leads from Facebook Ads (â‚¹300 cost each) = â‚¹4,500
- Total cost: â‚¹4,531.50
- You charge client: â‚¹20,000
- Your profit: â‚¹15,468.50

**Benefits:**
- Fast initial results (scraping)
- High-quality leads mixed in (ads)
- Client sees variety
- Balanced cost

---

### **Verification Process (DETAILED)**

**You asked:** "How will we verify it? We will have to call the leads?"

**Answer:** You DON'T have to call every lead! Use APIs:

**1. Phone Verification** (Automated)
- Tool: Truecaller API
- Cost: â‚¹0.50 per check
- What it checks:
  - Is number active?
  - Mobile or landline?
  - Carrier info
  - Spam score
- Result: "Active" or "Inactive"
- Goal: 90%+ active rate

**2. Email Verification** (Automated)
- Tool: Hunter.io or ZeroBounce
- Cost: â‚¹0.30 per check
- What it checks:
  - Is email format valid?
  - Does domain exist?
  - Does mailbox accept mail?
  - Is it a catch-all address?
- Result: "Valid" or "Invalid"
- Goal: 95%+ valid rate

**3. Manual Spot Check** (You call 3-5 leads)
- Pick 3-5 random leads from batch
- Call them to verify:
  - Number works
  - They're in the target industry
  - Contact info is correct
- If 3/3 are good â†’ Batch is good
- If 2/3 are bad â†’ Re-verify entire batch

**Total verification cost example:**
- 100 leads scraped
- Phone verification: 100 Ã— â‚¹0.50 = â‚¹50
- Email verification: 100 Ã— â‚¹0.30 = â‚¹30
- Manual calls: Your time (5 minutes)
- **Total: â‚¹80 to verify 100 leads**

**You deliver:** 30 best leads
**You charged:** â‚¹10,800
**Verification cost:** â‚¹24 (for 30 leads)
**Still profitable!**
