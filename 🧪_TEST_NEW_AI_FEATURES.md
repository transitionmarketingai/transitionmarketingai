## 🐛 Known Limitations (By Design)

### AI Ad Generator:
- Currently uses simulated data (not real OpenAI API)
- "Launch" button simulates action (doesn't actually launch ads)
- Can be integrated with real Meta/Google Ads API later

### Lead Enrichment:
- Uses simulated enrichment engine
- Ready for Clearbit/Hunter.io integration
- Data is realistic but not from live APIs

**Note:** These are demo-ready features with realistic data. Production integration requires API keys for:
- OpenAI (for real ad generation)
- Clearbit (for company data)
- Hunter.io (for email verification)
