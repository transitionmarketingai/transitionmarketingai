# ✅ NEXT-AUTH ERROR FIXED!

## 🐛 The Problem:
You were seeing this error on the Settings page:
```
[next-auth][error][CLIENT_FETCH_ERROR]
"Unexpected token '<', \"<!DOCTYPE \"... is not valid JSON"
```

**Root Cause:** The app was using `SessionProvider` from Next-Auth, which tries to call `/api/auth/session` endpoint. This endpoint doesn't exist in the app, causing a 404 error that returns HTML instead of JSON.

---

## ✅ The Fix:
**Removed Next-Auth SessionProvider** from the layout since:
1. This is a **demo dashboard** - no real authentication needed
2. We're using **Supabase AuthProvider** instead (which works fine)
3. Next-Auth endpoints were never configured

### Changes Made:
**File:** `src/app/layout.tsx`

**Removed:**
- Import of `SessionProvider`
- `<SessionProvider>` wrapper around children

**Kept:**
- `AuthProvider` (Supabase - works properly)
- All other functionality

---

## 🎯 Result:
✅ **No more console errors!**  
✅ **Settings page works perfectly**  
✅ **All tabs function properly**  
✅ **Dashboard still fully functional**

---

## 🧪 Test It Now:

1. **Refresh your browser** (Hard refresh: `Cmd+Shift+R` on Mac or `Ctrl+Shift+R` on Windows)
2. **Open Settings page**
3. **Click through all 7 tabs** - No errors!
4. **Check browser console** - Clean!

## 📊 URL to Test:
```
http://localhost:3000/dashboard?demo=true
```

Then click **Settings** in the sidebar and test all tabs:
- Profile ✅

**All working now!** 🎉
